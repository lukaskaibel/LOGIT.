import SwiftUI

/// The app's keyboard accessory: a row of glass capsules floating clear of the keys.
///
/// iOS draws its own glass slab behind a `.keyboard` toolbar item. That slab always sits flush
/// with the top row of keys and always takes the exact size of whatever we put inside it — so
/// padding grows the slab instead of lifting it, and content that stretches (an `HStack` with a
/// `Spacer`) dresses a single "hide the keyboard" button as a bar spanning the screen.
/// `sharedBackgroundVisibility(.hidden)` takes that slab away, which is what lets this row draw
/// its own capsules: each one hugs its buttons, so one action reads as one button, and the bottom
/// padding is real empty space, the way the bars in Notes and Reminders stand off the keyboard.
///
/// Callers compose the row themselves out of `KeyboardToolbarGroup` capsules and `Spacer()`s.
/// The house arrangement: whatever belongs to the *set* (a running rest timer, the rest editor)
/// on the leading edge, the keyboard's own controls on the trailing edge under the thumb.
///
/// Use it through `KeyboardToolbarItem` below, never by placing it in a `ToolbarItem` by hand —
/// that wrapper is what hides the system slab.

    /// Reminders keep.

    /// beside them can line it up. Measured rather than derived: the keyboard's reported frame
    /// starts a capsule's height above this row, and that gap is the system's to change.
