/// *mixed* strip by, so the strip is plotted on a **synthetic timeline**: one bin per day, counted off
/// an arbitrary epoch. Bin `i` sits on day `i`, the viewport is `binsPerWindow` days wide, and the
/// scroll snaps to midnight — which is to say to whole bins. The dates are pure geometry and never

/// the bar they name — and `valueAligned` scroll snapping, so a scroll comes to rest on whole bins.
