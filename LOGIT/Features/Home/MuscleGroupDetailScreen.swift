/// The single-muscle detail: how many sets this group got against how many its target share asks
/// for, a 2×2 stat grid, a sets-history chart following the selected window, and the top exercises
/// that train it. Opens scoped to the window the caller was showing — the Summary's picker carries
/// all the way down here through Muscle Groups. Pro — the full per-muscle breakdown is the analytics
/// behind the wall.
///
/// The hero counts **sets**, not share. A share is the right headline on the Muscle Groups screen,
/// where eight of them are being compared and only their relative sizes matter; on one muscle's own
/// page it is the wrong unit twice over. It reads as a progress percentage ("19%" looks like
/// something that should reach 100), and it is not actionable — nobody can train three more
/// percentage points, they train three more sets. So the target share is converted into the sets it
/// implies for this window, and the headline is the pair — beside the group's own filling track, the
/// same bar and badge the Muscle Groups screen draws, so the two screens read as one design.
///
/// The screen used to carry a calendar Week / Month / Year picker, which made it the one link in the
/// chain that changed vocabulary: Summary on four rolling weeks → Muscle Groups on four rolling
/// weeks → this screen on a calendar month, with the switch never mentioned. The route now hands
/// over a `TrendWindow` unchanged.
