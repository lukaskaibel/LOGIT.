/// hero — how many groups reached their target share, over the same filling tracks the Balance tile
/// draws — then the eight groups as a two-column grid of tiles. The 4 weeks / 3 months / 1 year picker
/// sets the window. Tiles tap through to the muscle's own page. Pro; the Summary's Balance tile is the
/// free hook into it.
///
/// It is the focus editor's twin. The editor sets priorities in a fixed two-column grid; this screen
/// reads results in the identical grid, in the same order, so a group sits in the same place on both
/// and "set there, read here" needs no explaining. It used to file the groups under Below / At / Above
/// target sections instead, which re-sorted the whole grid every time the window changed and said
/// again what each tile's badge already says.
///
/// It opens on `TrendWindow.default` — the same rolling four weeks the tile reports — and it only ever
/// describes the window the picker at its top names.
