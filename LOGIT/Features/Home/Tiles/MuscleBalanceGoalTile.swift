/// The Summary's Balance half: how many muscle groups reached their target share, over one filling
/// track each. Half width, paired with `StrengthTile`.
///
/// The headline counts groups that are **at least** their target, which is the rule the tracks
/// already draw — a bar visibly full while the count says otherwise is a tile arguing with itself.
/// That rule is `MuscleBalanceEntry.goalState`, and since the single-muscle detail adopted it too it
/// is the only reading of "at target" left in the app.
///
/// Untrained groups stay in the chart as empty tracks. A group with a real target and no sets is the
/// most out-of-balance state there is, and hiding it would make the tile look *better* the worse the
/// month went. Only a group the user has zeroed out drops away — that one can never fill, so it
/// leaves the denominator too.
///
/// It draws from the **first set on**, matching `MuscleGroupsOverviewScreen`, which is what the tile
/// taps through to. There used to be a 20-set floor here on the grounds that one session hits two or
/// three groups and so reports them "at or above target" purely because everything else is absent —
/// which is true, and the tile does read optimistically early on. But the detail screen never had
/// that floor, so the pair contradicted each other: a placeholder tile opening onto a fully drawn
/// split. One rule across both surfaces beats a defensible rule applied to only one of them.
