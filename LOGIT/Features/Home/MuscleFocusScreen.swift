/// The training-focus editor, in two parts: the focus itself — a tappable title over a stacked bar of
/// the week it describes — and the eight muscle groups as a two-column grid, each tile a weekly set
/// target between a round minus and plus (`MuscleTargetControl`).
///
/// Targets are real numbers of sets per week, not shares and not priority levels: it is the unit
/// programs are written in, it needs no explaining, and unlike a percentage split one group's number
/// never has to move because another's did. The four presets live in the title's menu as ready-made
/// weeks; any target change makes the focus "Custom" (the title says so, with nothing checked in the
/// menu). Setting a group to 0 takes it out of the focus.
///
/// Commits on every change through the `MuscleFocusStore`, so the Muscle Groups overview and the
/// Summary's Balance tile update live. Free — it's configuration, not analytics.
