/// workout could only ever fold half its panel, the list needed padding that tracked the fold, and
/// every scroll frame re-rendered the whole recorder. Here the list's viewport never changes and
/// the sheet reads one number.
///
/// **One number.** `reveal` is how far the panel hangs below the compact row, in points. Only the
/// small views that draw the panel, the title and the list's fade observe it, so a fold never
/// invalidates the recorder screen itself.
