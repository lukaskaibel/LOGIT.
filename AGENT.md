# UI verification: scenario matrix (mandatory for UI changes)

Every user-visible UI change must be verified in the simulator across the
app's critical data states, and the screenshots must be shown to the user in
the final response. Point out any scenario where the change looks wrong or
degenerate.

Present the result as a visual overview Artifact, not just text — this is the
expected closing deliverable for any substantial UI or behavioral change.
Build an HTML contact sheet (load the `artifact-design` skill first) that
embeds the simulator screenshots with one short caption per shot saying what
changed, so the states (and before/after) can be compared at a glance; still
include clickable file paths per scenario as a fallback. Reuse the same
Artifact across iterations of one change (redeploy the same file path). A
trivial or non-visual change just gets a concise written summary — don't force
an artifact for a one-liner.

The states, all driven by launch arguments (DEBUG builds only, implemented in
`LOGIT/App/TestScenarios.swift`):

| State | Launch arguments |
| --- | --- |
| Empty (brand-new user, 0 workouts, no goal) | `-SCENARIO empty` |
| One workout (single data points, fresh trends) | `-SCENARIO one` |
| Many workouts (long-time user, rich history) | `-SCENARIO many` |
| Free tier (Pro locked) | add `-UITEST_FORCE_FREE` to any scenario |
| Goal set but nothing logged yet (every user's Monday) | `-SCENARIO empty -workoutPerWeekTarget 4` — an explicit target beats the scenario's own, like `-weightUnit` |
| Stress (2 years dense history + in-progress workout; for performance work, not part of the standard matrix) | `-SCENARIO stress`, add `-UITEST_SHOW_RECORDER 1` to land in the recorder |

Standard matrix for a change: **empty, one, many (Pro implied on the
simulator) + the free variant of the most relevant scenario.** If the change
touches a Pro-gated feature, always show Pro vs. free side by side.

How scenarios work (so you don't fight them):

- A scenario boots a **fresh in-memory store** seeded for that state plus
  session-only UserDefaults overrides in the argument domain. Nothing
  persists, every launch is identical, and the simulator's real store and
  defaults are untouched. Flip side: overridden keys (`setupDone`,
  `weightUnit`, `workoutPerWeekTarget`, `pinnedExercises`,
  `pinnedMeasurements`, `muscleTargetSplit`, default-content version keys)
  read as pinned for the whole session, so tests/interactions that must
  *change* one of those keys should launch without the scenario instead.
- `many` is the curated preview dataset **without** the in-progress workout.
  Use `-UITEST_FIXTURES 1` when the mid-workout state (recorder, mini bar)
  is itself under test.
- Pro is force-unlocked in DEBUG simulator builds; `-UITEST_FORCE_FREE` is
  the only way to see locked/teaser states.

Capturing the matrix (agents; user is usually away — never wait for manual
checks):

1. Run the standing suite `LOGITUITests/ScenarioScreenshots.swift` — it walks
   the four tab roots per scenario and attaches screenshots:

   ```
   xcodebuild test -workspace LOGIT.xcworkspace -scheme LOGITScreenshots \
     -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro,OS=26.4' \
     -only-testing:LOGITUITests/ScenarioScreenshots \
     -resultBundlePath /tmp/scenarios.xcresult
   xcrun xcresulttool export attachments --path /tmp/scenarios.xcresult \
     --output-path /tmp/scenario-shots
   ```

   Use the **iOS 26.4** simulator runtime — the 26.0 runner dies
   nondeterministically. To capture only the states relevant to a small
   change, narrow further, e.g.
   `-only-testing:LOGITUITests/ScenarioScreenshots/testEmptyScenario`.
2. If the changed screen is not a tab root, temporarily add a test method to
   `ScenarioScreenshots.swift` that uses `launchApp(scenario:)` and navigates
   to it in each relevant scenario (one launch per test method — relaunching
   within a method kills the iOS 26 test runner). Remove the temp method
   afterwards.
3. Read the exported PNGs to verify the change yourself before showing them.

For manual testing there are shared schemes with the arguments preconfigured:
**LOGIT Empty / LOGIT One Workout / LOGIT Many Workouts** (each also carries a
disabled `-UITEST_FORCE_FREE` toggle — tick it in Edit Scheme for the free
tier). The plain LOGIT scheme keeps using the real on-disk store.

# CloudKit schema: always tell Lukas when a deploy is needed

**The production CloudKit schema never updates itself.** The Development
environment picks up model changes from a debug run, so sync keeps working on
your simulator and hides the problem completely. Production only changes when a
human opens the CloudKit console and presses **Deploy Schema Changes** — and
until they do, every new field writes locally and silently never syncs. Nothing
errors, nothing warns, and the feature simply doesn't work across devices.

This is the one release step no agent can perform. Lukas will not remember it on
his own, so **surfacing it is your job, every single time.**

## The rule

If a change adds or alters anything in `LOGIT/Data/Database/LOGIT.xcdatamodeld`
— a new model version, entity, attribute or relationship — then **the final
response for that change must end with a CloudKit deploy notice.** Not a footnote
mid-answer, not "worth noting at some point": the last thing Lukas reads. Repeat
it in the PR description too.

Name the record types and fields exactly as CloudKit shows them — Core Data
prefixes both with `CD_`, so `dropRepetitions` on `DropSet` appears as
`CD_dropRepetitions` on `CD_DropSet`. Say which feature stops working without
the deploy, in user terms.

```
⚠️ CloudKit deploy needed before this ships
Console → Development → Private DB → Record Types → Deploy Schema Changes
  CD_Workout   → CD_effortScore_     (effort ratings won't sync without it)
  CD_DropSet   → CD_dropRepetitions  (drop sets won't sync at all)
```

At release time, do this for **every model change since the last released
version**, not just the newest one — deploys are easy to do once and then
forget, and a field added after the last deploy is indistinguishable from one
added before it unless you check the dates.

## Schema rules that are not negotiable

- **Additive only.** Never remove a field, never rename one, and never
  reinterpret an existing field's meaning or unit. CloudKit keeps deployed
  fields forever; changing what one means corrupts every record already synced.
  Add a new field and dual-write instead (see `durationMillis` alongside the
  legacy seconds).
- **Never fix a collision with `renamingIdentifier`.** Inheritance is flattened
  into one record type, so two entities in the same hierarchy cannot both own a
  field of the same name — that is what kept drop sets from ever syncing. Move
  the field to its own name instead (`dropRepetitions`).
- **Every new attribute must be optional or carry a default.** CloudKit
  mirroring rejects a required attribute with no default.

## Verifying a deploy

`-INITIALIZE_CLOUDKIT_SCHEMA` (see `LOGITApp.swift`) runs
`initializeCloudKitSchema(options: [.printSchema])`, which prints the schema the
app *expects*. Diff that against the console's Record Types to see what is
actually deployed — the print alone proves nothing about production.

# App Store automation (Fastlane)

LOGIT ships to the App Store via [fastlane](https://fastlane.tools). All store
copy and screenshot captions live as plain text files under `fastlane/`, so an
agent can edit text and rerun a single lane to push changes live.

## Quick reference

| Task | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Update description / release notes / keywords | edit `fastlane/metadata/<locale>/*.txt`, then `bundle exec fastlane metadata` |
| Pull current live metadata into repo | `bundle exec fastlane download_metadata` |
| Pull current live screenshots into repo | `bundle exec fastlane download_screenshots` |
| Regenerate screenshots after UI change | `bundle exec fastlane screenshots` |
| Restyle screenshot captions / colors only | edit `fastlane/screenshots/**`, then `bundle exec fastlane reframe` |
| Capture + frame + upload in one shot | `bundle exec fastlane refresh_screenshots` |
| Ship a new TestFlight build | `bundle exec fastlane beta` |
| Submit a new App Store release | tag `vX.Y.Z` and push, or `bundle exec fastlane release` |

All lanes authenticate with an App Store Connect API key (`.p8`), so no 2FA
prompts ever appear.

## What lives where

- `Gemfile` - pins fastlane + xcpretty. Run `bundle install` once.
- `fastlane/Appfile` - app identifier, Apple ID, team IDs.
- `fastlane/Matchfile` - points at the private cert repo.
- `fastlane/Fastfile` - all lanes (see table above).
- `fastlane/Snapfile` - snapshot devices (6.9" iPhone) + locales
  (`en-US`, `de-DE`, `es-MX`, `es-ES`, `fr-FR`, `pt-BR`, `ja`, `ko`, `it`).
- `fastlane/metadata/<locale>/*.txt` - App Store Connect store listing copy.
  One field per file; edit and upload via `fastlane metadata`.
- `fastlane/screenshots/<locale>/title.strings` - headlines drawn above each
  framed screenshot.
- `fastlane/screenshots/<locale>/keyword.strings` - short (1-2 word) accent
  text drawn in a highlight color above the title.
- `fastlane/screenshots/Framefile.json` - universal styling (fonts, colors,
  padding, background) with per-screenshot overrides.
- `LOGITUITests/LOGITScreenshots.swift` - one test method per screen. Add a
  new method + update `title.strings` / `keyword.strings` to add a new
  marketing screenshot.
- `LOGIT/App/ScreenshotFixtures.swift` - routes the app to the seeded
  in-memory preview database when launched with `-UITEST_FIXTURES 1`.

## One-time setup (humans only)

This only needs to happen once per machine.

1. **Install toolchain**
   ```
   bundle install
   ```
2. **Bootstrap the UI test target.** The UI test target isn't in the Xcode
   project yet; run this helper to add it using the `xcodeproj` gem that
   ships with fastlane:
   ```
   bundle exec ruby fastlane/bootstrap_uitest_target.rb
   ```
   Then open Xcode once so the shared scheme gets regenerated.
3. **Generate an App Store Connect API key.** App Store Connect -> Users
   and Access -> Integrations -> App Store Connect API -> generate a key
   with role "App Manager". Download the `.p8`, note the Key ID + Issuer
   ID. Fastlane needs the same key in two shapes - the raw `.p8` (for
   Fastfile lanes) and a JSON config wrapper (for direct CLI tools like
   `fastlane match` and `fastlane deliver`):
   ```
   mkdir -p ~/.appstoreconnect
   mv /path/to/AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8 ~/.appstoreconnect/
   chmod 600 ~/.appstoreconnect/AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8
   jq -Rn --arg k "$(cat ~/.appstoreconnect/AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8)" \
     '{key_id:"XXXXXXXXXX", issuer_id:"00000000-0000-...", key:$k, in_house:false}' \
     > ~/.appstoreconnect/asc_api_key.json
   chmod 600 ~/.appstoreconnect/asc_api_key.json
   cp fastlane/.env.secret.example fastlane/.env.secret
   # edit with the real paths + IDs
   ```
4. **Set up `fastlane match`** with a new private repo (e.g.
   `lukaskaibel/logit-certs`):
   ```
   bundle exec fastlane match appstore
   ```
5. **Drop in the frameit assets** that aren't checked in for licensing
   reasons. See `fastlane/screenshots/README.md` for the two files you
   need to add manually (SF Pro fonts + `background.png`).
6. **Pull the authoritative metadata from App Store Connect** to replace
   the placeholder copy that was scaffolded in the repo:
   ```
   bundle exec fastlane download_metadata
   ```

## GitHub Actions

`.github/workflows/release.yml` runs the same lanes in CI:

- Push tag `vX.Y.Z` -> runs `fastlane release` automatically.
- `workflow_dispatch` -> pick any lane (`beta`, `release`, `metadata`,
  `upload_screenshots`) from the UI.

Required GitHub Actions secrets:

- `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_KEY_ID`
- `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_ISSUER_ID`
- `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_CONTENT` (base64 of the `.p8` contents)
- `MATCH_GIT_URL` (e.g. `https://github.com/lukaskaibel/logit-certs.git`)
- `MATCH_GIT_BASIC_AUTHORIZATION` (base64 of `user:personal_access_token`)
- `MATCH_PASSWORD`
- `SECRETS_SWIFT_CONTENT` (the literal contents of `LOGIT/Config/Secrets.swift`)

Screenshot capture stays local by default because running `xcodebuild test`
against multiple simulators on CI is slow and fragile - but
`upload_screenshots` does work in CI since it only needs the framed PNGs
that are committed to the repo.

### Bug reports fixed by Claude (`claude-bugfix.yml`)

An issue labelled `bug` starts an unattended fix. Lukas files these from an iOS Shortcut, which
creates the issue with the label already applied. Only issues Lukas both opened and labelled
count, because the report becomes the agent's instructions and the result merges without review.

1. **Fix** (macOS): Claude reads the report and this file, then either commits a fix with a
   regression test on `claude/bugfix-<issue>`, or reports `not_a_bug` / `needs_info` /
   `could_not_fix`. It never pushes or opens the pull request itself. The workflow opens it.
2. **Tests**: `tests.yml` runs on that commit through `workflow_call`, since a branch pushed with
   the workflow token triggers no CI of its own. **Regression tests** also runs any UI tests
   Claude named.
3. **Merge**: squash-merges only the tested commit, and only once both pass.
4. **Report**: every outcome ends as a comment on the issue.

If you are the agent in that run, the prompt in the workflow overrides this file's screenshot
matrix and Artifact contact sheet: nobody is there to see them, so tests are the verification.
A fix that touches `LOGIT.xcdatamodeld` is left open instead of merged (CloudKit deploy first),
and one that edits `.github/` can't be pushed at all.

It needs a `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` repository secret. To retry an
issue, remove the `bug` label and add it again; an open fix PR for the issue blocks a retry
until it is closed.

## Conventions for agents

- Screenshot names follow `NN_Name` (e.g. `01_Home`, `02_History`) and the
  same key must exist in both `title.strings` and `keyword.strings` for
  both locales.
- Release notes must stay under 4000 characters per locale and should not
  contain Markdown - App Store Connect renders them as plain text.
- **Localization is mandatory for user-facing text.** LOGIT currently supports
  app locales `en`, `de`, `es`, `fr`, `pt-BR`, `ja`, `ko`, and `it`, plus App
  Store locales `en-US`, `de-DE`, `es-MX`, `es-ES`, `fr-FR`, `pt-BR`, `ja`,
  `ko`, and `it`. Any change that adds or edits user-facing text must update
  all supported `Localizable.strings` files. If the change affects App Store
  copy or screenshots, update every matching `fastlane/metadata/<locale>` and
  `fastlane/screenshots/<locale>` file. If the change touches default
  exercises, localize both the `_default.exercise.*` names and the localized
  instruction arrays in `LOGIT/Resources/default_exercises.json`. Default
  templates (`LOGIT/Resources/default_templates.json`) keep their structure in
  the JSON but localize their `_default.template.*` names and descriptions in
  every `Localizable.strings` file.
- Keep translations close to the English length where possible, but do not make
  them awkward. Use natural Apple-style platform wording, preserve product
  terms such as iCloud, App Store, Live Activity, Dynamic Island, and LOGIT Pro,
  and use normal fitness terminology for each locale.
- Localized legal Markdown files include machine-translated text for app
  coverage. Treat legal text as requiring human/legal review before release.
- Never commit `fastlane/.env.secret`, the raw `.p8`, or anything inside
  `fastlane/builds/` - these are all gitignored.
- If a UI change breaks one of the screenshot UI tests, update the
  navigation inside `LOGITUITests/LOGITScreenshots.swift` rather than
  skipping the test.

### Templates mirror workouts (keep them in lock-step)

A template is the blueprint of a workout, so the two must look and behave like
one product. **Any change to how a workout's set groups or sets are presented
must be applied to the template side in the same change** - never leave the
template editor/detail looking like the previous generation of the workout UI.

The paired surfaces are:

| Workout | Template |
| --- | --- |
| `WorkoutSetGroupCell` | `TemplateSetGroupCell` |
| `WorkoutSetCell` | `TemplateSetCell` |
| `WorkoutSetGroupList` (recorder + `WorkoutDetailScreen`) | `TemplateEditorScreen` + `TemplateDetailScreen` lists |

Shared visual vocabulary lives in `LOGIT/SharedUI/Views/SetGroupThread.swift`
(the thread's trunk, index bulge, superset rails, row shadow/z-order) and in
`Color.threadLine`. Put anything both sides draw there rather than duplicating
it, so a tweak lands on both at once.

**Only mirror what actually exists on both sides.** Some concepts are
workout-only because a template has no session to compare against or run:
per-exercise metric/improvement badges, previous-set reference values,
personal-record peeks, the live rest timer/chronograph, and the session note.
Templates likewise own things workouts don't (planned rest display states). When
a workout change touches a workout-only concept, note that in the PR instead of
inventing a template equivalent.

When you do change a paired surface, verify the template screens too - the
scenario matrix already captures Templates (`*_04_templates`), and
`ScenarioScreenshots.testTemplateEditorSuperset` covers the superset layout.

## Known quirks

- **Leading-dot bundle ID.** The registered App IDs in Apple's Developer
  Portal are literally `.com.lukaskbl.LOGIT` and
  `.com.lukaskbl.LOGIT.LOGITWidgetExtension` (with a leading dot), which
  matches the value already in `project.pbxproj`. `fastlane/Appfile`,
  `fastlane/Matchfile`, and the `XCUIApplication(bundleIdentifier:)` call
  in `LOGITScreenshots.swift` therefore also use `.com.lukaskbl.LOGIT`.
  Do not "fix" this without also re-registering the App IDs on
  developer.apple.com and updating the Xcode project in lock-step - it
  would invalidate the existing provisioning profiles and break uploads.
- **Widget version must match app version.** Both Info.plists resolve
  `CFBundleShortVersionString` to `$(MARKETING_VERSION)` and `CFBundleVersion`
  to `$(CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION)`, so the pbxproj is the single source for both
  — but the app and widget targets each carry their own `MARKETING_VERSION`.
  Bump both together or Apple rejects the build at submission. Never hardcode a
  version back into either plist: it silently outranks the build setting, so
  `increment_build_number` writes a number nothing reads and the lane uploads a
  binary still claiming the old build.
- **`LOGITScreenshots` is a separate scheme.** `LOGIT.xcscheme` still
  includes `LOGITTests` (the unit test bundle) in its test action, but
  fastlane snapshot uses a dedicated `LOGITScreenshots.xcscheme` so a
  broken unit test can't block marketing screenshots.
